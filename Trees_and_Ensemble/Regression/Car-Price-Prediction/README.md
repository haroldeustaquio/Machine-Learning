# Car Price Prediction Dataset

This dataset contains various features related to cars, including the year of manufacture, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, number of previous owners, mileage, and engine specifications. These attributes provide valuable insights into the factors influencing car prices and can be used to develop predictive models for estimating the selling price of cars.
