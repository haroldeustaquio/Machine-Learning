# Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction

## Situation

This project aims to predict the status of cirrhosis patients based on various clinical and demographic features. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains information about patients' conditions, treatments, and outcomes. The goal is to classify the patients' status into three categories: death (D), censored (C), and censored due to liver transplantation (CL).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [cirrhosis patient survival prediction dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/878/cirrhosis+patient+survival+prediction+dataset-1). The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
2. **N_Days**: Number of days between registration and the earlier of death, transplantation, or study analysis time in July 1986.
3. **Status**: Status of the patient: C (censored), CL (censored due to liver transplant), or D (death).
4. **Drug**: Type of drug administered (D-penicillamine or placebo).
5. **Age**: Age in days.
6. **Sex**: Gender of the patient (M for male, F for female).
7. **Ascites**: Presence of ascites (N for No, Y for Yes).
8. **Hepatomegaly**: Presence of hepatomegaly (N for No, Y for Yes).
9. **Spiders**: Presence of spider angiomata (N for No, Y for Yes).
10. **Edema**: Presence of edema (N for no edema, S for edema without diuretics, Y for edema despite diuretic therapy).
11. **Bilirubin**: Serum bilirubin levels in mg/dl.
12. **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol levels in mg/dl.
13. **Albumin**: Albumin levels in gm/dl.
14. **Copper**: Urine copper in Âµg/day.
15. **Alk_Phos**: Alkaline phosphatase levels in U/liter.
16. **SGOT**: SGOT levels in U/ml.
17. **Triglycerides**: Triglyceride levels in mg/dl.
18. **Platelets**: Platelet count per cubic ml/1000.
19. **Prothrombin**: Prothrombin time in seconds.
20. **Stage**: Histological stage of disease (1, 2, 3, or 4).

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are utilized for data processing, model building, and evaluation:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing utilities.
- `xgboost`: For implementing XGBoost classifier.
- `catboost`: For using CatBoost classifier.
- `iterative-imputer`: For handling missing data.

## Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were applied to the dataset, and their performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The following models were utilized:
